 <h1 style="color:ghostwhite";>Signifigance to Computer Science</h1>
  <p>In 1976, Steve Jobs founded Apple Computer Inc. with Steve Wozniak. In 1979, Steve led a small group of engineer’s and discovered that by using a Graphical User Interface, he can make computers easier to use and more efficient. In the early 1980s, Steve began to engineer the Macintosh, or Mac as the computer became known. This was the first model that the Macbooks which we see today are derived from. At first, the computer’s were underpowered and expensive, and when Jobs failed to properly address the issue he was removed from Apple in 1985. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="p">
    <p>Following his departure from Apple, Jobs founded NeXT inc., a computer firm which specialized in designing powerful workstation computers for education. NeXT was significant at the time for its unique engineering design, however eventually it lost popularity due to there being less expensive computers. In 1986, Jobs founded Pixar Animation studios, a computer graphics design firm which he would build into a major animation studio over the next few decades. In 1995, Pixar made a large achievement for the animation industry, producing the full-length film that was completely computer animated, Toy Story. </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="p">
    <p>In 1997, Jobs would rejoin Apple and save it from going bankrupt, since it had begun to experience financial losses in years prior. In 1998, he introduced the Imac, a one-piece computer that offered high speed processing at a reasonable price. This made other companies follow suit in making similar computers, which made quality technology more accessible to the public. At the turn of the 21st Century, Jobs introduced Itunes, a program for playing music and converting to MP3. Later in the year, Apple began selling the IPod, which quickly became the market leader in MP3 players. </p>
  </div>
 
  <div class="p">
    <p>In 2007, Apple introduced the IPhone, which had the capabilities of a normal mobile telephone, but could also play MP3s, videos, and had access to the internet and games. This was unique because it was the first device which had access to all of these options. Later in the same year, they released the IPod Touch, which had the same MP3 playing abilities as the normal IPod, but also offered access to video games and had an IPhone like touchscreen. Soon, the IPhone and IPod touch offered more games than any other portable gaming system. </p>
